# HANGMAN-GAME-PROJECT

Project Title: Hangman Game

Description:
The Hangman Game is a classic word-guessing game where one player thinks of a word and the other player(s) try to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of attempts.
It's a fun and interactive way to challenge vocabulary and guessing skills. This project is a digital implementation of the traditional pen-and-paper game, allowing users to play it on a computer or mobile device.

Instructions for Playing Hangman:
Objective: The objective of the game is to guess the hidden word before running out of attempts.

Starting the Game: When you start the game, you'll see a message welcoming you to Hangman.

Guessing the Word: You'll be presented with a series of underscores, each representing a letter in the hidden word. You need to guess letters one at a time to uncover the word.

Guessing Letters: Enter a single letter as your guess and press Enter. The game will tell you if the letter you guessed is in the word or not.

Correct Guesses: If your guessed letter is in the word, it will be revealed in the appropriate position(s) in the word.
Incorrect Guesses: If your guessed letter is not in the word, the game will deduct one attempt from your total attempts remaining.

Remaining Attempts: You start with 5 attempts. Each incorrect guess reduces your attempts by 1.

Winning: If you correctly guess all the letters in the word before running out of attempts, you win! The game will congratulate you and reveal the hidden word.

Losing: If you run out of attempts before guessing the word correctly, the game ends, and it will reveal the hidden word.

Playing Again: After the game ends, you'll be asked if you want to play again. If you choose "yes," the game will start again with a new hidden word. If you choose "no," the game will end with a thank you message.;
